UNIQUE-ID - Pseudo-Products
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - This class is a subclass of Frames because it does not make sense for it to be a subclass of anything else,
COMMENT - because Pseudo-Products do not actually exist.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Features
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of of this class define a region of interest on a polypeptide, plus, 
/optionally, one or more states associated with the region.  Different subclasses are used to specify
/points, linear regions, and regions involving noncontiguous segments of an amino-acid chain.
/
/If there is a need to refer to two different states of a protein with a given feature (e.g. phosphorylated or
/unphosphorylated, metal-bound or not, crosslinked or not)  a Modified-Protein frame must be created
/that points back to the unmodified form.  Both forms of the protein point to the same feature, but the state
/annotation on the feature for each form indicates whether it is modified or not, or bound or not.  The state of a feature 
/can be left unspecified if it is not relevant to interactions of a particular protein form, and of course many 
/feature classes have no state.  The slot Possible-Feature-States indicates whether or not a feature class
/can have multiple states, and what those states are.
/
/For example, an instance F of this class could define an amino-acid residue that
/can be phosphorylated, plus the fact that this residue can take on two possible
/states: MODIFIED (i.e. phosphorylated) and UNMODIFIED (i.e. unphosphorylated).   The feature instance
/itself does not describe the state of a particular protein.  Instead, we would
/represent the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of a protein by
/creating two instances of class Proteins.  Both of those instances, in their
/FEATURES slot, would contain the value F, linking to the same feature
/instance.  However, in the two proteins, F would be annotated differently
/to indicate the state of that feature.   One protein would use an 
/annotation label STATE with a value MODIFIED to denote
/that the residue is phosphorylated, and would also be classified under the class Modified-Proteins,
/whereas the other would have the value UNMODIFIED for the state annotation.
/
/Most covalent modifications to proteins can be found in the subclass Modification-Features.  For these
/features, the specific class of the feature usually unambiguously defines the modification (if it does not,
/the chemical structure slots can be used for that purpose).  
/
/For cases in which a protein forms a non-covalent complex with some other entity, this is represented
/using an instance of the Complexes class.  In this case, a feature may be created to specify where on the protein
/the other entity binds (with the ATTACHED-GROUP slot indicating its identity), but it is rarely 
/necessary to indicate the state of the feature -- interactions refer to either the
/protein or the complex, but rarely need to distinguish between the complex, the protein within the complex, and the
/free protein.  If however it is necessary to distinguish between those three cases, then, as in the covalent modification
/case, a modified protein would need to be created, and the state (BOUND or UNBOUND) of the feature would need
/to be set for each form of the protein.

UNIQUE-ID - Growth-Observations
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of this class record observations of growth/no-growth for the wildtype organism and/or various gene knockouts.
/One instance of this frame can record whether a single organism (wildtype or knockout mutant) grows on a single growth medium,
/or, for purposes of compactness, it can record that a set of one or more knockouts (or wildtype) grows or does not grow on a 
/set of one or more growth media.  However, all knockouts or media grouped together in a single instance should be part of 
/a single experiment or coherent set of experiments (i.e. the same citations and comment applies to all), must describe growth at 
/a single temperature, and must all exhibit the same growth status (none, low or normal growth).

UNIQUE-ID - Generalized-Reactions
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMON-NAME - All Pathways and Reactions
//
UNIQUE-ID - Gene-Ontology-Terms
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Class Gene-Ontology-Terms is the root of the Gene Ontology (GO).  In a PGDB,
/gene products (including monomers, multimers, and chemically modified forms
/thereof) are assigned to GO terms in this hierarchy.  Note that a PGDB does not contain
/the entire GO ontology, it contains only those terms (and their parents) to which gene products have been
/assigned.  To browse the entire GO ontology, visit the <a href="http://www.geneontology.org">GO website</a>.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Evidence
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - The Evidence class defines a controlled vocabulary of evidence types.  Each term in the vocabulary 
/defines a type of evidence that pertains to an assertion in this database.  Example assertions include 
/the assertion that a pathway exists, or the assertion that an operon exists.  Example uses of the 
/evidence vocabulary are to record what type of evidence supports the assertion that an operon exists, 
/such as whether the evidence is based on a computational analysis or a wet-lab experiment, and if the 
/latter, what type of wet-lab experiment.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Enzymatic-Reactions
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - An instance of this class defines an association between an enzyme and
/a reaction that the enzyme catalyzes.  The slots of this class define
/information specific to that association, such as small molecules that
/act as cofactors of the catalysis of that
/reaction by that enzyme, and kinetic parameters of the enzyme.
/Enzymatic-Reactions also link via the Regulated-By slot to
/objects that define substrate-level regulation of this enzyme activity.
/It is improper to store that information with either the reaction or the
/enzyme because a given enzyme might catalyze multiple reactions,
/and a given reaction might be catalyzed by more than one enzyme.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - EC-BOOKKEEPING
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - This slot stores meta-information used to track changes to the EC taxonomy, e.g. deleted or merged EC numbers.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Databases
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMON-NAME - Databases
//
UNIQUE-ID - Compound-Mixtures
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of this class are used to define sets of compounds, or mixtures.
/Example uses include describing the biomass composition of an organism for the purpose
/of computational analysis, and describing growth media.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Collections
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - A group of frames, usually all of the same class, that are associated together in a single logical collection.  This is a utility class -- its only slot of its own is group-members.  Each of its subclasses will define a type of collection, and specify the class of frames that can be members.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Chemicals
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMON-NAME - a chemical
COMMENT - An instance of this class is a chemical entity of some type, including
/elements, small molecular weight chemical compounds, and
/macromolecules.  This class does not include fragments of 
/molecules, such as regions within a protein.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Cell-Types
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - This class is used to distinguish between different types of cells within a single organism.
//
UNIQUE-ID - CCO
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMON-NAME - Cell Component Ontology
COMMENT - This class is the root of the Cell Component Ontology.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - This class describes most forms of protein, RNA or activity regulation.  Regulation can be either by a direct influence on the protein's activity 
/(e.g. allosteric inhibition of an enzyme) or by influencing the quantity of active protein available (e.g. by inducing or blocking its transcription 
/or translation).  The one form of regulation that is not covered by this class is when the quantity of a protein is regulated as a result of chemical 
/or binding reactions that either produce or consume the active form of a protein -- these are represented as Reactions instead.  There can be
/some ambiguity as to what should be represented as a reaction and what should be represented as a regulation event.  In general, an event that
/can be represented as a reaction should be when a) there is sufficiently detailed information known to model it as a reaction, b) both reactants
/and products exist as stable, independent entities, and c) our schema supports referring to both reactant and product of the reaction independently 
/and there is some justification for wanting to go down to that level of detail.  For example, a transcription factor bound to a small molecule will 
/generally have a different activity than the unbound transcription factor.  This could be represented either as the reaction TF + x -> TF-x or as 
/a regulation event in which x activates or inhibits the activity of TF.  However, because both TF and TF-x are stable molecules which can 
/potentially regulate different transcription units (not all will, but some do), or TF could bind another small molecule y and regulate yet another set 
/of transcription units, we prefer to model this kind of interaction as a reaction when the data is available.  On the other hand, an enzyme binding to 
/some inhibitor could also be represented as a reaction, but since there is rarely any reason to refer to the enzyme-inhibitor complex outside of
/the context of the reaction the enzyme catalyzes, we choose instead to model these events as regulation events in which the inhibitor regulates the
/activity of the enzyme.
/
/Instances of this class represent a one-to-one mapping between regulator and regulated-entity (i.e. an entity may regulate many processes,  or a
/process may be regulated by many entities, but each one requires its own instance of Regulation to represent it)
//
UNIQUE-ID - Organizations
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - An instance of this class defines an organization with which an author of
/information in a PGDB is associated.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - People
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - An instance of this class describes a person who has contributed information
/to a PGDB as a curator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Organisms
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - The Organisms class is used in different ways in organism-specific
/PGDBs versus in multiorganism PGDBs such as MetaCyc.  The
/next paragraph discusses what is common to both types of PGDBs.
/Subsequent paragraphs describe the differences.
/
/In all PGDBs, subclasses of Organisms define biological taxa, at all
/possible taxonomic levels.  Class-subclass relationships between
/subclasses of Organisms describe their taxonomic relationships,
/since, for example, the class Bacteria includes as a subclass the
/class Alphaproteobacteria.  Generally, most of the taxonomic
/groups under Organisms correspond to entries from the NCBI Taxonomy 
/database (which is stored in its entirety in a separate Ocelot KB).  But in
/addition to taxa from NCBI Taxonomy, a PGDB can contain subclasses 
/for additional taxa that are not present in the NCBI Taxonomy. 
/
/Organism-specific PGDBs:  In an organism-specific PGDB, the only
/frames that exist as children of Organisms are those frames needed to
/describe the taxonomic lineage of the organism described by the PGDB.
/An organism-specific PGDB contains a single instance frame that
/describes information about the PGDB itself.  A parent class P of that 
/instance must exist to describe the lowest taxonomic group defined for the
/organism.  Additional parent classes exist as parents of P and
/children of Organisms that describe the other known taxonomic
/parents of P.  No other children of Organisms exist in the PGDB.
/
/Multiorganism PGDBs such as MetaCyc:  Multiorganism PGDBs contain
/no instances of class Organisms, but only subclasses of this class.  Those 
/subclasses define each of the different organisms for which MetaCyc
/(for example) defines pathways and enzymes.  For economy of storage, 
/only those taxa (and their parent taxa) actually referenced in the PGDB are
/stored in the PGDB, so that only a subset of the NCBI Taxonomy is 
/replicated in the PGDB. There is only one instance of  
/Multi-Organism-Groupings that describes the properties of the PGDB.  
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Publications
TYPES - FRAMES
COMMENT - Instances of this class are publications, usually those cited within a PGDB.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Growth-Observation-Datasets
TYPES - Collections
//
UNIQUE-ID - Paralogous-Gene-Groups
TYPES - Collections
COMMENT - Each instance of this class describes a single group
/of paralogous genes.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Phenotype-Microarray-Plates
TYPES - Collections
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Reactions
TYPES - Regulation
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Gene-Products
TYPES - Regulation
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Enzyme-Activity
TYPES - Regulation
COMMENT - Instances of this class describe substrate-level modulation of enzyme activity.  The
/situation where a small molecule competitively inhibits an enzyme activity would
/be represented as follows:
/Regulator            = The small molecule
/Regulated-Entity = The enzymatic reaction for that enzyme activity
/Mechanism          = Competitive
/Mode                  = +
/
/Possible mechanisms and their definitions are as follows:
/Allosteric          -- Allosteric regulators increase or decrease the enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and inducing a conformational change that alters the affinity of the enzyme to its substrates without affecting its VMAX.
/Competitive       -- Competitive inhibitors bind reversibly to the enzyme, preventing the substrate from binding.  Binding of the inhibitor and substrate are mutually exclusive because it is assumed that the inhibitor and substrate can both bind only to the free enzyme.
/Noncompetitive  -- Noncompetitive inhibitors can bind to either the free enzyme or to the enzyme-substrate complex.  The inhibitor and substrate may be bound to the enzyme simultaneously and do not exclude each other.  However, only the enzyme-substrate complex (not the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex) is catalytically active.
/Uncompetitive    -- Uncompetitive inhibitors inhibit the enzyme by binding reversibly to the enzyme-substrate complex, but not to the enzyme alone.
/Mixed               -- Mixed inhibitors can bind to either the free enzyme or the enzyme-substrate complex, and decrease the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate.
/Irreversible        -- Irreversible inhibitors bind to the enzyme and dissociate so slowly that it is considered irreversible.  For example, alkylating agents such as iodoacetamide irreversibly inhibit the catalytic activity of some enzymes by modifying cysteine side chains.
/Other                -- Regulators that regulate the enzyme activity by a mechanism that has been characterized but cannot be clearly classified as one of the above mechanisms.
/
/If no mechanism is specified, then the mechanism is unknown, either because the mechanism has yet to be elucidated in the experimental literature, or because a full literature search has yet to be performed.

UNIQUE-ID - EV-ND
TYPES - Evidence
COMMON-NAME - No biological data available
COMMENT - EV-ND is intended for use in GO annotations.
/
/Use of the EV-ND evidence code indicates that the annotator at the contributing database found no information
/that allowed making an annotation to any term indicating specific knowledge from the ontology in question
/(molecular function, biological process, or cellular component) as of the date indicated. This code should be used only
/for annotations to the root terms, molecular function ; GO:0003674, biological process ; GO:0008150, or cellular component ; GO:0005575,
/which, when used in annotations, indicate that no knowledge is available about a gene product in that aspect of GO.
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-COMP
TYPES - Evidence
COMMON-NAME - Inferred by computational analysis
COMMENT - Inferred from computation.  The evidence for an assertion comes from a
/computational analysis.  The assertion itself might have been made
/by a person or by a computer, that is, EV-COMP does not specify whether
/manual interpretation of the computation occurred.
/

COMMENT - Inferred by curator.  An assertion was inferred by a curator from relevant
/information such as other assertions in a database.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-AS
TYPES - Evidence
COMMON-NAME - Author statement
COMMENT - Author statement.  The evidence for an assertion comes from an author
/statement in a publication, where that publication does not state direct experimental support
/for the assertion.  Ordinarily, this code will not be used directly -- generally one of
/its child codes, EV-TAS or EV-NAS, will be used instead.

UNIQUE-ID - CCO-SURFACE-MAT
TYPES - CCO
COMMON-NAME - cell surface matrix
SYNONYMS - proteinaceous extracellular matrix
//
UNIQUE-ID - GO:0018065
TYPES - Gene-Ontology-Terms
COMMON-NAME - obsolete protein-cofactor linkage
COMMENT - 1. Making inferences in GO about compounds based on the cofactor role curated by ChEBI creates relationships that are not always true which violates ontological principles for GO; therefore we will cease making these inferences. 2. It is not meaningful to group protein modification processes that are not all chemically related by the fact that they may be used as a cofactor.

UNIQUE-ID - Consensus-Growth-Results
TYPES - Growth-Observations
COMMENT - Instances of this class do not represent primary growth observations.  Rather, if there are multiple conflicting growth observations for a particular medium/knockout, then an instance of this class can be used to represent the consensus view of what the correct growth-status result should be for those conditions.  Generally at most one instance of this class will exist for a given medium/knockout/temperature combination.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Growth-Conditions
TYPES - Growth-Observations
COMMENT - Instances of this class describe the environmental conditions under which some set of data was collected.  These instances can be supplied as the value of the CONDITIONS
/annotation for environment-specific slots such as TRANSCRIPT-COPY-NUMBER.  The growth conditions that can be specified include temperature, pH, aerobicity, growth-media
/and gene knockouts (although the wildtype organism is assumed by default).  Any description of environmental conditions that cannot be captured via these slots should be
/described using the COMMENT slot. It is not necessary to specify a growth-status.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Primary-Growth-Observations
TYPES - Growth-Observations
COMMENT - Instances of this class record primary observations of growth/no-growth for the wildtype organism and/or various gene knockouts,
/as described in the primary literature.
/One instance of this frame can record whether a single organism (wildtype or knockout mutant) grows on a single growth medium,
/or, for purposes of compactness, it can record that a set of one or more knockouts (or wildtype) grows or does not grow on a 
/set of one or more growth media.  However, all knockouts or media grouped together in a single instance should be part of 
/a single experiment or coherent set of experiments (i.e. the same citations and comment applies to all), must describe growth at 
/a single temperature, and must all exhibit the same growth status (none, low or normal growth).

//
UNIQUE-ID - Polymer-Segment-Enzyme-Substrates
TYPES - Compounds
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
COMMON-NAME - a polymer segment enzyme substrate
COMMENT - This class contains reaction substrates that stand for a segment or section of an extended polymer, like a nucleic acid.
/An enzyme might typically recognize a limited motif on the polymer, but the detailed sequence of the full length polymer will not matter in such reactions.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Growth-Media
TYPES - Compound-Mixtures
COMMENT - A growth medium is described as a set of compounds, which together form a mixture.
/The set of compounds is listed in the COMPOSITION slot.
//
UNIQUE-ID - mRNA-Segments
TYPES - Polymer-Segments
COMMENT - This class defines segments within mRNA transcripts.  Although any given mRNA is a transcript of only
/a small portion of the replicon, for precision's sake, start and end locations of mRNA segments are defined relative to the start
/of the corresponding replicon, not relative to the start of the mRNA transcript.  This approach also
/allows us to avoid creation of frames for the transcripts themselves.
/

/Slot ATTACHED-GROUP specifies that entity.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Translation
TYPES - Regulation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, translation of an mRNA transcript is regulated to activate or inhibit formation of the

UNIQUE-ID - Activation-Inactivation-Interconversion
TYPES - Pathways
COMMON-NAME - Activation/Inactivation/Interconversion
COMMENT - This class holds pathways for activation, inactivation, and interconversion of
/metabolic compounds.
/
/In contrast to a standard "biosynthesis" pathway in which a biologically active
/compound is synthesized from precursor molecules, activation pathways involve
/relatively minor chemical modifications to existing compounds that result in a
/substantial increase in their biological activity.
/
/Similarly, in contrast to standard "degradation" pathways in which a more complex
/compound is broken down into a set of simple metabolites, inactivation pathways
/involve relatively minor chemical modifications to existing biologically active
/compounds that result in a substantial decrease in their biological activity.
/
/
/Interconversion pathways describe the bidirectional conversion of a bio-molecule
/to a different form. The forward and backward conversions often result in
/significant changes in the biological activity of the compound, thus resulting in its
/activation and deactivation, respectively.
/
/These modifications may be either reversible or irreversible.

//
UNIQUE-ID - RNA-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a small regulatory RNA binds to a roughly complementary region on the mRNA transcript (specified
/in slot Associated-Binding-Site), possibly with the aid of one or more chaperones or accessory proteins (specified in slot
/Accessory-Proteins), to regulate translation.  Regulation may be by directly interfering with translation (for example,
/by directly blocking or by inducing some change in secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site), by
/causing (or preventing) the mRNA to be targeted for degradation, or by some combination of the two.  The Mechanism slot
/is used to indicate which of the above two mechanisms of action are involved, if known.  If a specific RNAse is specified
/in slot Associated-RNAse, then the sRNA targets the mRNA to be degraded by that particular RNAse.
/
/In instances of this class, the regulated entity will be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript
/whose translation is being regulated.  The regulator will be an sRNA. 
//
UNIQUE-ID - Compound-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMON-NAME - Small-Molecule-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a small molecule directly activates or inhibits translation of the mRNA without requiring the mediation of a regulatory protein.  
/Typically, a region of the mRNA transcript (recorded in the slot Associated-Binding-Site) acts as a riboswitch or ribosensor and binds the regulating 
/molecule directly.  This induces a change in mRNA secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site, or interferes in some other 
/way with the translation initiation process.  Alternatively, the small molecule can act by causing or preventing the targeting of the transcript for 
/degradation, or by translational attenuation, interacting with the ribosome to cause or prevent premature termination of translation.  The Mode slot records
/the specific regulation mechanism, if known.
/
/In instances of this class, the regulated entity will generally be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript whose
/translation is being regulated (although it is also possible for the regulated entity to be an individual gene).  The regulator will be a small molecule.

TYPES - EV-COMP
COMMON-NAME - Inferred computationally without human oversight
COMMENT - Automated inference.  A computer inferred this assertion through one of many possible methods such as

/from computational evidence, use EV-COMP-HINF.
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-EXP-IMP
TYPES - EV-EXP
COMMON-NAME - Inferred from mutant phenotype
COMMENT - IMP inferred from mutant phenotype.<br>
/The assertion was inferred from a mutant phenotype such as
/<ul>
/    <li> Any gene mutation/knockout
/    <li> Overexpression/ectopic expression of wild-type or mutant genes
/    <li> Anti-sense experiments
/    <li> RNA interference experiments
/    <li> Specific protein inhibitors
/    <li> Complementation
/</ul><p>	
/Comment: Inferences made from examining mutations or
/abnormal levels of only the product(s) of the gene of interest are covered by code EV-IMP
/(compare to code EV-IGI). Use this code for experiments that use antibodies 
/or other specific inhibitors of RNA or protein activity, even though no
/gene may be mutated (the rationale is that EV-IMP is used where an
/abnormal situation prevails in a cell or organism).
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Mediated-Translation-Regulation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Translation
COMMENT - In this class of regulation, a regulatory protein activates or inhibits translation of the mRNA.   The protein can directly interfere with translation initiation
/by binding to the mRNA transcript (at a location recorded in the slot Associated-Binding-Site) and either directly blocking the ribosome binding site, or
/by inducing a change in secondary structure that blocks or unblocks the ribosome binding site or interferes in some other way with the translation initiation
/pathway.  Alternatively, the protein can process the transcript in some way to cause or prevent its targeting for degradation.  A third option is that by 
/translational attenuation, the protein can interact with the ribosome to cause or prevent premature termination of translation.  The Mode slot records the 
/specific regulation mechanism, if known.
/
/In instances of this class, the regulated entity will generally be a transcription unit, since the transcription unit defines the mRNA transcript whose 
/translation is being regulated (although it is also possible for the regulated entity to be a gene).  The regulator will be a protein.

UNIQUE-ID - EV-EXP-IDA
TYPES - EV-EXP
COMMON-NAME - Inferred from direct assay

UNIQUE-ID - EV-EXP-IPI
TYPES - EV-EXP
COMMON-NAME - Inferred from physical interaction
COMMENT - IPI inferred from physical interaction<br>
/The assertion was inferred from a physical interaction such as

/    <li> 2-hybrid interactions
/    <li> Co-purification
/    <li> Co-immunoprecipitation
/    <li> Ion/protein binding experiments
/</ul><p>
/This code covers physical interactions between the gene product of
/interest and another molecule (or ion, or complex). For functions such
/as protein binding or nucleic acid binding, a binding assay is
/simultaneously IPI and IDA; IDA is preferred because the assay
/directly detects the binding. For both IPI and IGI, it would be good
/practice to qualify them with the gene/protein/ion. 
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-EXP-IEP
TYPES - EV-EXP
COMMON-NAME - Inferred from expression pattern
COMMENT - IEP inferred from expression pattern.<br>
/The assertion was inferred from a pattern of expression data such as

/    <li> Transcript levels (e.g. Northerns, microarray data)
/    <li> Protein levels (e.g. Western blots)
/</ul>
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-EXP-TAS
TYPES - EV-EXP
COMMON-NAME - Traceable author statement to experimental support
COMMENT - Traceable author statement to experimental support.  The assertion was made in a publication -- such as a review or 
/in another database -- that itself did not describe an experiment supporting the
/assertion.  However, the statement did reference another publication describing an experiment 
/that supports the assertion.  The difference between the codes EV-EXP-TAS and EV-AS-TAS 
/is that the former code is used when it is certain that experimental evidence supports the
/assertion, and the latter code is used when there is a possibility that an experiment was
/not done to support the assertion.
/In general, references to the primary literature are preferred,
/but this code can be used when the original article is difficult to locate.
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-EXP-IGI
TYPES - EV-EXP
COMMON-NAME - Inferred from genetic interaction
COMMENT - IGI inferred from genetic interaction.<br>
/The assertion was inferred from a genetic interaction such as
/<ul>
/    <li> "Traditional" genetic interactions such as suppressors, synthetic lethals, etc.
/    <li> Functional complementation
/    <li> Inference about one gene drawn from the phenotype of a mutation in a different gene
/</ul><p>
/This category includes any combination of alterations in the sequence
/(mutation) or expression of more than one gene/gene product. This
/category can therefore cover any of the IMP experiments that are done
/in a non-wild-type background, although we prefer to use it only when
/all mutations are documented. When redundant copies of a gene must all
/be mutated to see an informative phenotype, use the IGI code. (Yes, 
/this implies some organisms, such as mouse, will have far, far more IGI
/than IMP annotations.)<p>
/
/IMP also covers phenotypic similarity: a phenotype that is informative
/because it is similar to that of another independent phenotype (which
/may have been described earlier or documented more fully) is IMP (not IGI).<p>
/
/We have also decided to use this category for situations where a
/mutation in one gene (gene A) provides information about the function,
/process, or component of another gene (gene B; i.e. annotate gene B
/using IGI).

UNIQUE-ID - EV-IC-ADJ-GENES-SAME-BIO-PROCESS
TYPES - EV-IC
COMMON-NAME - Products of adjacent genes in the same biological process
COMMENT - A transcription unit is inferred because there is a set of adjacent genes,
/encoded in the same direction, coding for products that participate in the
/same metabolic pathway or biological process. Sometimes, these genes code
/for subunits of the same protein.
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-AS-NAS
TYPES - EV-AS
COMMON-NAME - Non-traceable author statement
COMMENT - Non-traceable author statement.  The assertion was made in a publication such as a review, a meeting abstract, 
/or another database without a reference to a publication describing an experiment that supports the assertion.
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-AS-TAS
TYPES - EV-AS
COMMON-NAME - Traceable author statement
COMMENT - Traceable author statement.  The assertion was made in a publication -- such as a review or 
/in another database -- that itself did not describe an experiment supporting the
/assertion.  The statement referenced another publication that supported the assertion,
/but it is unclear whether that publication described an experiment that supported
/the assertion.  The difference between the codes EV-EXP-TAS and EV-AS-TAS 
/is that the former code is used when it is certain that experimental evidence supports the
/assertion, and the latter code is used when there is a possibility that an experiment was
/not done to support the assertion.

/but this code can be used when the original article is difficult to locate.
//
UNIQUE-ID - EV-AS-HYPO
TYPES - EV-AS
COMMON-NAME - Author hypothesis
COMMENT - Author hypothesis. The hypothesis is in a publication, but it was clearly indicated in the
/publication that there was no experimental evidence, or limited evidence, supporting the 
/hypothesis. This code can be used, for example, for "paper chemistry" metabolic pathways, 
/which are pathways drawn from the author's best estimation.

UNIQUE-ID - Gene-Fragments
TYPES - DNA-Segments
COMMON-NAME - Gene-Fragments
COMMENT - This class is used when a single gene or pseudogene is made up of
/multiple fragments that are not adjacent on the chromosome.  Examples
/of when the use of gene-fragments is called for include a) when a
/pseudogene has been interrupted by one or more insertion elements so
/now comprises multiple non-contiguous segments, b) when a significant
/section of DNA (containing other genes) is excised before
/transcription, and a single transcript is produced from non-contiguous
/DNA segments, and c) to represent trans-splicing.  Gene fragment
/objects should NOT be created when a) a deletion results in a
/pseudogene that is nonfunctional because it is missing a portion of
/the gene, but still comprises a single segment (create this as a
/regular pseudogene instead), b) a gene product results from splicing
/together multiple exons within a single contiguous gene (use the

UNIQUE-ID - Reactions-Classified-By-Conversion-Type
TYPES - Reactions
COMMON-NAME - Reactions Classified By Conversion Type
COMMENT - This class is the root of an ontology in which reactions are classified by the type of 
/transition that occurs, whether by a change in covalent bonding, by a  weak binding interaction,
/or via a complex multistep process, etc.  This reaction ontology is orthogonal to the classification 
/of reactions by substrate classes, that is, many reactions will have parents in both ontologies.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Regulation-of-Transcription-Initiation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Transcription
//
UNIQUE-ID - Transcriptional-Attenuation
TYPES - Regulation-of-Transcription
COMMENT - This class describes the regulation of gene expression by transcription attenuation, or the premature termination of transcription.
/In all cases, the regulated-entity will be a terminator, although if precise terminator information is unknown then this frame may 
/alternatively be linked to a transcription-unit or gene.  When a terminator is specified, only genes in a transcription-unit that lie 
/downstream from the regulated terminator will have their expression regulated by instances of this class.
/
/Even though the regulated-entity may be a terminator, the value of the MODE slot refers to the overall effect on gene expression.
/Thus, a regulator that blocks termination at a terminator is considered an activator, and the value of the MODE slot will be "+",
/while a regulator that promotes termination is a repressor, with a value of "-" for the MODE slot.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Transcription-Units
TYPES - DNA-Segments
COMMENT - An instance of this class defines a transcription unit, meaning a set of one
/or more genes that are transcribed to produce a single messenger RNA.  
/The differences between a transcription unit and an operon
/are (1) Technically, an operon must include more than one gene.  
/(2) An operon may include more than one promoter.  For operons that
/include multiple promoters, a transcription unit is defined for each promoter.
/
/A transcription unit should have as its components one or more genes,
/zero or one promoter, and zero or more terminators.  Transcription factor binding sites
/need not be components of a transcription unit.  A one-to-one correspondence is
/defined between a transcription unit and a promoter plus set of genes.  Promoters can
/be omitted if the transcription start site is unknown, in which case the correspondence
/is between a transcription unit and a set of genes.  Multiple terminators can be included 
/in a transcription-unit, but typically a separate transcription unit is defined for each 
/different set of transcribed genes (an exception is made for attenuators --
/generally no transcription unit is defined for the truncated transcript produced by
/attenuation, even if it includes the gene for a leader peptide).

COMMON-NAME - protein-containing complex
SYNONYMS - GO:0043234
SYNONYMS - macromolecular complex
SYNONYMS - macromolecule complex
SYNONYMS - protein containing complex
COMMENT - A protein complex in this context is meant as a stable set of interacting proteins which can be co-purified by an acceptable method, and where the complex has been shown to exist as an isolated, functional unit in vivo. Acceptable experimental methods include stringent protein purification followed by detection of protein interaction. The following methods should be considered non-acceptable: simple immunoprecipitation, pull-down experiments from cell extracts without further purification, colocalization and 2-hybrid screening. Interactions that should not be captured as protein complexes include: 1) enzyme/substrate, receptor/ligand or any similar transient interactions, unless these are a critical part of the complex assembly or are required e.g. for the receptor to be functional; 2) proteins associated in a pull-down/co-immunoprecipitation assay with no functional link or any evidence that this is a defined biological entity rather than a loose-affinity complex; 3) any complex where the only evidence is based on genetic interaction data; 4) partial complexes, where some subunits (e.g. transmembrane ones) cannot be expressed as recombinant proteins and are excluded from experiments (in this case, independent evidence is necessary to find out the composition of the full complex, if known). Interactions that may be captured as protein complexes include: 1) enzyme/substrate or receptor/ligand if the complex can only assemble and become functional in the presence of both classes of subunits; 2) complexes where one of the members has not been shown to be physically linked to the other(s), but is a homologue of, and has the same functionality as, a protein that has been experimentally demonstrated to form a complex with the other member(s); 3) complexes whose existence is accepted based on localization and pharmacological studies, but for which experimental evidence is not yet available for the complex as a whole.

UNIQUE-ID - Interconversion
TYPES - Activation-Inactivation-Interconversion
COMMON-NAME - Interconversions
COMMENT - This class contains interconversion pathways. These pathways describe the
/bidirectional conversion of a bio-molecule to a different form. The forward and
/backward conversions often result in significant changes in the biological activity
/of the compound, thus resulting in its activation and deactivation, respectively.
/
/Interconversion pathways are different from biosynthetic or degradative cyclic
/pathways in the fact that they lack an input and/or output flux. For example, the
/purpose of the |FRAME: CALVIN-PWY "Calvin Cycle"|, which is a biosynthetic cycle, is CO<sub>2</sub>
/fixation. As the cycle turns there is a net input of carbon dioxide and net output
/of fructose 6-phosphate. In the interconversion pathway |FRAME:PWY-2345|, on
/the other hand, the purpose of the cycle is simply to convert the compounds
/genistein, genistin and malonylgenistin to each other in a reversible manner.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Respiration
TYPES - Energy-Metabolism
COMMENT - This class contains pathways of respiration by which various organisms generate,
/both aerobically and anaerobically, a trans-membrane ion gradient to serve as a
/source of energy.
/
/Like |FRAME: Fermentation fermentation|, respiration is a process by which
/electrons are passed from an electron donor to a terminal electron acceptor.
/However, in respiration the electrons do not pass directly from the donor to the
/acceptor. Instead, they pass a number of membrane-bound electron carriers that
/function as a transport chain, passing the electrons from one to another in steps
/that follow the electrochemical gradients between the electron donor and the
/acceptor.
/
/Each oxidized member of the electron transfer chain (which can be
/|FRAME: Flavoproteins|, |FRAME: ETR-Quinones|, |FRAME: Cytochromes|, or other
/type of electron carrier) can be reduced by the reduced form of the preceding
/member, and the electrons flow through the chain all the way to the terminal
/acceptor, which could be |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE| in the case of
/|FRAME: AEROBIC-RESPIRATION "aerobic respiration"|, or another type of molecule in
/|FRAME: ANAEROBIC-RESPIRATION "anaerobic respiration"|.
/
/Known terminal acceptors involved in anaerobic respiration include organic
/compounds (|FRAME: FUM|, |FRAME: DMSO|, or |FRAME: TRIMETHYLAMINE-N-O|),
/or inorganic compounds (|FRAME: NITRATE|, |FRAME: NITRITE|,
/|FRAME: NITROUS-OXIDE|, |FRAME: CHLORATE|, |FRAME: CPD0-1385|,
/|FRAME: MN+3 "oxidized manganese ions"|, |FRAME: FE+3 "ferric iron"|, gold,
/|FRAME: SELENATE|, |FRAME: ARSENATE|, |FRAME: SULFATE| and
/|FRAME: Elemental-Sulfur "elemental sulfur"|).
/
/During the process of electron transfer, a proton gradient is formed across the
/membrane due to three potential processes
/
/1. The use of some of the energy associated with the electron transfer for active
/pumping of protons across a membrane.
/
/2. Exporting protons out of the cell during electron-to-hydrogen transfers.
/
/3. Scalar reactions that consume protons on one side of a membrane, or produce them
/on the other side of the membrane, without actually moving a proton from one
/compartment to another.
/
/Upon passage of protons back into the cytoplasm, they drive multisubunit
/|FRAME: EC-7.1.2.2 "ATP synthase"| enzymes that generate ATP.

//
UNIQUE-ID - Transcription-Factor-Binding
TYPES - Regulation-of-Transcription-Initiation
COMMENT - Instances of this class describe regulation of transcription initiation whereby the binding of an RNA-polymerase to
/a transcription unit promoter is activated or inhibited by the binding of some entity (generally a transcription factor) to some nearby
/DNA binding site.  The regulator in this case is the transcription factor, and the regulated-entity is the transcription unit promoter
/(although what is really being regulated is the transcription of the transcription unit to produce RNA).  If no promoter has been identified
/for a transcription unit, or no transcription unit for a regulated gene, it is possible to specify the transcription unit or the gene itself as the 
/regulated-entity instead of the promoter, although it is understood that these cases describe incomplete information.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Rho-Blocking-Antitermination
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - Rho-dependent termination requires binding of the Rho hexamer upstream of terminator sites in a nascent transcript.
/In this class of attenuation, a regulator molecule causes the ribosome to stall adjacent to the Rho-factor
/binding site.  This prevents Rho from binding, thereby preventing Rho-dependent termination, and
/transcription continues.The regulator in this case is the regulator molecule, generally a protein, and the 
/regulated-entity is the Rho-dependent terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - RNA-Polymerase-Modification
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, a regulatory protein binds to a site in a transcription unit and interacts with
/RNA polymerase, such that the modified RNA polymerase is no longer sensitive to termination signals, 
/and transcription continues past one or more terminators.  The regulator is the regulatory protein and the 
/regulated-entity is a terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - RNA-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, the attenuator consists of two competing stem-loop structures in the mRNA: an 
/antiterminator, which allows further transcription, and a terminator, which ends it.  An RNA pairs with a 
/region on the leader transcript to either stabilize or block the formation of an antiterminator, thus preventing 
/or allowing formation of the competing terminator, and consequently activating or inhibiting transcription.  
/Examples include the binding of an uncharged tRNA to a T box region on the leader transcript to stabilize an 
/antiterminator, or the pairing of an antisense RNA with its complementary strand to block antiterminator formation.  
/The regulator in these cases is an RNA and the regulated-entity is the terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Ribosome-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, the intracellular level of a charged tRNA determines whether or not the ribosome
/pauses while synthesizing a leader peptide.  The pause site consists of a series of one or more codons for a 
/particular amino acid.  The ribosome, which moves sequentially along the transcript, synthesizing protein, must 
/wait for a tRNA charged with that amino acid before it can proceed further.  Thus, the intracellular level
/of that amino acid determines how much charged tRNA is available, and therefore whether or not the 
/ribosome pauses.  The newly forming mRNA transcript can adopt one of two competing stem-loop conformations, a
/terminator or an antiterminator structure.  In all cases described so far, pausing favors the formation of
/an antiterminator structure, thus preventing terminator formation, and allowing gene expression.  The regulator
/in this case will be the particular charged tRNA, and the regulated-entity is the terminator.

UNIQUE-ID - Protein-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, an RNA-binding protein will interact with the nascent transcript in order
/to determine which of two competing RNA stem-loop structures form: a terminator (thereby terminating transcription)
/or an antiterminator (thereby allowing transcription to continue).  When acting as an activator, the protein
/stabilizes the antiterminator, preventing terminator formation.  When acting as an inhibitor, the protein
/blocks antiterminator formation, allowing terminator formation.  The regulator in these cases is the
/RNA-binding protein and the regulated-entity is the terminator.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Small-Molecule-Mediated-Attenuation
TYPES - Transcriptional-Attenuation
COMMENT - In this class of attenuation, the mRNA leader transcript can bind directly to small molecule ligands
/(the mRNA region in this case is also known as a riboswitch).  This binding determines which of two
/mutually exclusive RNA structures forms, a terminator or an antiterminator.  If the small molecule
/blocks antiterminator formation and thereby promotes terminator formation, it will inhibit transcription.  
/If it promotes antiterminator formation, it activates transcription beyond the terminator region.

SYNONYMS - DNA binding transcription factor activity
SYNONYMS - gene-specific transcription factor activity
SYNONYMS - sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity
COMMENT - Usage guidance: Most DNA-binding transcription factors do not have enzymatic activity. The presence of specific DNA-binding domains known to be present in DNA-binding transcription factors (HOX, GATA etc) should be used to help decide whether a protein is a DNA binding transcription factor or a coregulator. If a protein has an enzymatic activity (for example, ubiquitin ligase, histone acetyl transferase) and no known DNA binding domain, consider annotating to GO:0003712 transcription coregulator activity. Special care should be taken with proteins containing zinc fingers, Myb/SANT and ARID domains, since only a subset of proteins containing these domains directly and selectively bind to regulatory DNA motifs in cis-regulatory regions.

//
UNIQUE-ID - IS-Elements
TYPES - Transposons
SYNONYMS - Insertion Sequence Element
SYNONYMS - Insertion Sequence
COMMENT - An IS element is a short DNA sequence that acts as a transposable element, meaning
/it can change its position within the genome.  IS elements are small relative to other
/transposable elements, and they code only for proteins (e.g., transposases) involved in transposition
/activity.  When IS elements occur in the middle of genes, they interrupt the coding
/sequence and inactivate the gene.  IS elements can also block the expression of
/other genes within the same operon.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - REP-Elements
TYPES - Extragenic-Sites
COMMENT - A Repetitive Extragenic Palindrome (REP) element is a short base pair sequence capable of producing a stem-loop structure.  REP elements
/are located in different orientations and arrays between genes within an operon or at the end of an operon.  They are always found
/outside of structural genes.  Groups of REP elements are also known as BIMEs (bacterial-interspersed mosaic elements).  The actual function of these
/elements is unclear.  They may act as mRNA stabilizers, targets for DNA gyrase binding, or hot spots for transposition and recombination events.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Phage-Attachment-Sites
TYPES - Extragenic-Sites
COMMENT - Instances of this class are sites on the genome that are recognized by complementary sites on a phage, and are used by the phage to insert its DNA into the genome (lysogeny).
//
UNIQUE-ID - Origin-of-Replication
TYPES - Extragenic-Sites
COMMENT - The origin of replication is a particular sequence in the genome at which replication is initiated.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Pathogenicity-Islands
TYPES - Genomic-Islands
COMMENT - Pathogenicity islands (PAIs) are a class of genomic islands that are present in the genome of pathogenic microorganisms, but are usually absent from non-pathogenic
/organisms of the same or closely related species.  They contain genes that code for one or more virulence factors, such as adhesins, toxins, invasins, etc.  PAIs are discrete genetic units flanked by direct repeats, insertion sequences or tRNA genes, which are sites for recombination into the DNA.   They can be transferred as a single unit to new cells, thus conferring virulence to formerly benign strains.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Truncated-Genes
TYPES - All-Genes
COMMENT - The genes classified here have a truncated sequence, on the left or right side.
/This can occur at the ends of a contig.
/Because the full sequence is not known, no amino acid translation can be shown.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Pseudo-Genes
TYPES - All-Genes
COMMENT - Pseudo genes are regions of DNA that show sequence similarity to other functional genes, but that
/are not in fact functional genes.   A pseudogene might be nonfunctional because of sequence
/changes that prevent its transcription or translation, such as by disrupting its promoter
/or by introducing a premature stop codon.
/
//
UNIQUE-ID - Phantom-Genes
TYPES - All-Genes
COMMENT - Phantom genes are regions of DNA that were once thought to be genes
/(such as because they were identified as genes by a computational
/gene-finding program), but that are not currently
/thought to be functional genes, for example because their expression has never
/been observed.  They are maintained in the database to maintain a
/record of their past versus current status.

UNIQUE-ID - ANAEROBIC-RESPIRATION
TYPES - Respiration
COMMON-NAME - Anaerobic Respiration
COMMENT - Like |FRAME: Fermentation fermentation|, respiration is a process by which
/electrons are passed from an electron donor to a terminal electron acceptor.
/However, in respiration the electrons do not pass directly from the donor to the
/acceptor. Instead, they pass a number of membrane-bound electron carriers that
/function as a transport chain, passing the electrons from one to another in steps
/that follow the electrochemical gradients between the electron donor and the
/acceptor.
/
/Each oxidized member of the electron transfer chain (which can be
/|FRAME: Flavoproteins|, |FRAME: ETR-Quinones|, |FRAME: Cytochromes|, or other
/type of electron carrier) can be reduced by the reduced form of the preceding
/member, and the electrons flow through the chain all the way to the terminal
/acceptor, which could be |FRAME: OXYGEN-MOLECULE| in the case of
/|FRAME: AEROBIC-RESPIRATION "aerobic respiration"|, or another type of molecule in
/|FRAME: ANAEROBIC-RESPIRATION "anaerobic respiration"|.
/
/Known terminal acceptors involved in anaerobic respiration include organic
/compounds (|FRAME: FUM|, |FRAME: DMSO|, or |FRAME: TRIMETHYLAMINE-N-O|),
/or inorganic compounds (|FRAME: NITRATE|, |FRAME: NITRITE|,

/|FRAME: SELENATE|, |FRAME: ARSENATE|, |FRAME: SULFATE| and
/|FRAME: Elemental-Sulfur "elemental sulfur"|).
/
/During the process of electron transfer, a proton gradient is formed across the
/membrane due to three potential processes
/
/1. The use of some of the energy associated with the electron transfer for active
/pumping of protons across a membrane.
/
/2. Exporting protons out of the cell during electron-to-hydrogen transfers.
/
/3. Scalar reactions that consume protons on one side of a membrane, or produce them
/on the other side of the membrane, without actually moving a proton from one
/compartment to another.
/
/Upon passage of protons back into the cytoplasm, they drive multisubunit
/|FRAME: EC-7.1.2.2 "ATP synthase"| enzymes that generate ATP.

UNIQUE-ID - GO:0001539
TYPES - GO:0048870
COMMON-NAME - cilium or flagellum-dependent cell motility
SYNONYMS - ciliary/flagellar motility
COMMENT - Note that we deem eukaryotic cilia and microtubule-based flagella to be equivalent, while the bacterial- and archaeal-type flagella have a different structure. The former are microtubule-based structures that lash back and forth and are present only in eukaryotes, while the latter achieve motility by rotation. Bacterial- and archaeal-type flagella are superficially similar but have a different molecular composition and fine structure. These three structures never co-exist in the same organism. Therefore, GO:0001539 'cilium or flagellum-dependent cell motility' is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term. Direct annotations to GO:0001539 'cilium or flagellum-dependent cell motility' may be amended during annotation QC.

COMMON-NAME - an [arsenite methyltransferase]
COMMENT - |FRAME: EC-2.1.1.137|, catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups from |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| to
/an arsenic (III) species. The enzyme is found in members of the archaea, bacteria, and eukarya, encoded by the arsM or xxx genes |CITS: [11790780][15025511][16407288]|
/
/The understanding of the enzyme's function has evolved siginificantly over the years. According to the current (2019) model, derived from the human enzyme, the true substrate is |FRAME: CPD-22658| |CITS: [15526190]|. |FRAME: GLUTATHIONE Glutathione|, the major thiol in mammalian cells, is present at millimolar concentrations and reacts readily with arsenite to form the triglutathione complex inside cells.
/
/The methyltransferase binds As(III) in a series of three thiol transfer reactions from |FRAME: CPD-22658|, resulting in As(III) that is 3-coordinately bound to three conserved cysteine residues |CITS: [29894638]|. Once bound to the enzyme, the following steps take place |CITS: [25325836][25760600]|:
/
/(1) The methyl group of SAM is attacked by the arsenic lone pair;
/
/(2) A pentavalent |FRAME: METHYLARSONATE| intermediate is formed and reduced to an enzyme-bound |FRAME: METHYLARSONITE| intermediate by Cys32, with formation of a Cys32&ndash;Cys61 disulfide;
/
/(3) The disulfide is reduced with electrons from thioredoxin;
/
/At this point the substrate can dissociate from the enzyme, forming a cytosolic pool of |FRAME: METHYLARSONITE|. However, this dissociation is slow since |FRAME: METHYLARSONITE| has high affinity for two cysteine residues of the binding site, and thus in most cases the enzyme proceeds to the next step: 
/
/(4) The enzyme undergoes the next round of methylation, forming a pentavalent |FRAME: DIMETHYLARSINATE| intermediate;
/
/(5) The intermediate is reduced to |FRAME: DIMETHYLARSINOUS-ACID| by Cys61, resulting in a Cys61&ndash;Cys156 disulfide;
/
/(6) The disulfide bond is reduced by a second thioredoxin molecule, regenerating the enzyme and releasing |FRAME: DIMETHYLARSINOUS-ACID|.
/
/In some cases the enzyme can catalyze three rounds of methylation instead of two, generating  the volatile compound |FRAME: CPD-22659| |CITS: [27730229]|.
/
/The sturcture shown depicts the three cysteine residues that bind the arsenic atom.

COMMENT - Blue copper proteins, which are also known as cupredoxins, are small (1017 kDa),  soluble proteins whose active site contains a type-I copper.
/They shuttle electrons from a protein acting as an electron donor to another acting as an electron acceptor in various biological systems, such as bacterial and plant photosynthesis.
/
/|FRAME: Plastocyanins "Plastocyanins"| are found in cyanobacteria, algae, and plants, where they play a role in the photosynthetic process by shuttling electrons from cytochrome f to photosystem I.
/
/|FRAME: Azurins Azurins| and |FRAME: Pseudoazurins pseudoazurins| participate in denitrification processes in bacteria. 
/
/|FRAME: Amicyanins Amicyanins| participate in the oxidizing electron transport chain of some methylotropic bacteria. 
/
/The only known |FRAME: Rusticyanins rusticyanin| plays a fundamental role in iron oxidation by the bacterium |FRAME: TAX-920|, where it  shuttles electrons from Fe(II) to cytochrome c552. 
/
/CBPs, also known as plantacyanins, and stellacyanins are plant-specific blue copper proteins belonging to a subgroup defined as phytocyanins.

UNIQUE-ID - Redox-Electron-Carriers
TYPES - Acceptors
COMMON-NAME - a redox electron carrier
COMMENT - In general, an electron carrier is a chemical entity that can accept or donate electrons from/to another chemical entity.
/When accepting electrons, it acts as an "electron acceptor". By accepting the electrons, the acceptor is reduced, and thus prior to receiving the electrons the entity is called  "an oxidized electron acceptor" and after receiving them it is called "a reduced electron acceptor".
/
/Many reduced electron acceptors are able to transfer the electrons to other molecules, becoming oxidized in the process. Thus the distinction between an electron acceptor and an electron donor is often not determined by the actual chemical entity, but by the role it plays in a particular reaction. However, some acceptors in biological reactions only accept electrons and do not transfer them further. Those are often known as "terminal electron acceptors".
/
/While in general every chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred includes an electron donor and an electron acceptor, several molecules are commonly used in metabolism solely for the purpose of electron transfer, and are referred to in biology as electron carriers. Different biological electron carriers differ in the number of electrons that they transfer and in their electron affinity.
/
/Some of the common biological electron carriers transfer only a single electron (e.g. |FRAME: Cytochromes cytochromes|, |FRAME: Blue-Copper-Proteins "blue copper proteins"|, and some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer two electrons (e.g. some |FRAME: Ferredoxins ferredoxins|), some transfer a hydride ion ( e.g. |FRAME: NAD| and |FRAME: NADP|), and some transfer two electrons and two protons (|FRAME: ETR-Quinones quinones|, |FRAME: FAD| and |FRAME: FMN|).
/In addition, a number of inorganic small molecules (e.g. oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), manganese (IV), sulfate) are often used as terminal electron acceptors.

UNIQUE-ID - LONG-CHAIN-KETONE

COMMON-NAME - a ketone
COMMENT - a ketone is a compound with the structure RC(=O)R', where R and R' can be a variety of atoms and groups of atoms. It features a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two other carbon atoms.
/
/Ketones differ from |FRAME: Aldehydes aldehydes| in that the carbonyl is placed between two carbons rather than at the end of a carbon skeleton.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Reduced-Quinones
TYPES - Aromatics
COMMON-NAME - a quinol
SYNONYMS - quinol
SYNONYMS - a hydroquinone
SYNONYMS - a reduced quinone
COMMENT - A quinol, or hydroquinone, is the fully reduced form of |FRAME: Quinones|.
/
/Quinones are organic compounds derived from aromatic compounds, with two carbonyl groups incorporated into the ring structure with rearrangement of the double bonds where necessary. Quinones are conjugated but not aromatic.
/
/A classic example of a quinone is |FRAME: P-BENZOQUINONE|. Quinones are commonly named with a prefix that indicates the parent aromatic hydrocarbon (for example, "benzo-" for benzene, "naphtho-" for naphthalene, and "anthra-" for anthracene) with a "-quinone" suffix.
/
/Several types of quinones serve as electron acceptors in electron transport chains. Quinones can carry two electrons, and when fully reduced they are referred to as |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinols|. The addition of a single H atom to a quinone results in formation of a free radical called |FRAME: Semiquinones|.
/
/Many quinone derivatives often have other biological activities, such as |FRAME: CPD-11501 "vitamin K"|.

/been obtained, such as from sequence analysis.  In some cases ORFs have
/been predicted from complete genomes using gene-finding programs, but
/have no sequence similarity to known proteins.  Examples of genes we would
/consider ORFs include those annotated with the functions "hypothetical protein",
/"conserved domain protein", and "inner membrane protein".  Examples of genes we would not consider
/ORFs include those annotated as "oxidoreductase",  "hypothetical transporter",
/"ATPase", and "kinase".

UNIQUE-ID - Redox-Half-Reactions
TYPES - Simple-Reactions
COMMON-NAME - Redox Half-Reactions
COMMENT - Redox half reactions are elementary reactions, in which explicitly
/stated electrons are reducing an oxidized molecular species.  These
/reactions do not stand alone, because electrons do not occur freely.
/Instead, a half reaction must be paired with another half reaction to
/form a complete, overall transformation.
/
/The convention adopted here is to write the half reactions always in
/the same direction, namely in the form:
/
/Ox. + e- --> Red.
/
/In other words, the oxidized species and the electrons are always in
/the LEFT slot, and the reduced species are always in the RIGHT slot.
/
/This reaction direction allows the standard reduction potential to be
/directly recorded in the STD-REDUCTION-POTENTIAL slot, such that
/reactions of this type are comparable with each other.

/noncovalently binds to or unbinds from another molecule via weak bonds (e.g. hydrogen bonds).  This class includes protein complex assembly 
/and dissociation reactions.   In reactions of this class, each of the substrates maintains its original molecular identity, meaning reactions of this class
/affect intermolecular bonds, not intramolecular bonds.

UNIQUE-ID - All-tRNAs
TYPES - ssRNAs
COMMON-NAME - a tRNA
SYNONYMS - a transfer RNA
COMMENT - A transfer RNA (tRNA) is is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group of the aminoacyl-adenylate to the 2' or 3' terminal OH of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes).
/
/This class encompasses both charged and uncharged tRNA molecules.
//
UNIQUE-ID - tmRNAs
TYPES - ssRNAs
COMMON-NAME - tmRNA
COMMENT - The bacterial tmRNA is so-named for its dual tRNA-like and mRNA-like nature.

/C-terminal peptide tag to unfinished protein, which targets it for proteolysis.

UNIQUE-ID - Composite-Reactions
TYPES - Chemical-Reactions
COMMON-NAME - Composite Reactions
COMMENT - A composite reaction R is represented both as a net chemical
/transformation, and a set of sub-reactions of which R is comprised.
/Those sub-reactions represent finer grained details of the reaction.
/Thus, composite reactions may have their mechanistic details recorded,
/when such information is available.  The relationships among the
/sub-reactions are stored in the same way as are the relationships of
/reactions within a pathway (i.e. using the Reaction-List/In-Pathway and 
/Predecessors slots).  As a result, composite reactions exhibit
/hybrid properties: internally, they are constructed like pathways, and
/externally, they look like reactions.
/
/The LEFT and RIGHT slots of composite reactions reflect the overall
/inputs and outputs of the composite transformation.  At a later point
/in time, these slots should be automatically kept in synch with the
/sub-reactions.  However, currently the Reaction Editor will have the
/burden of updating the LEFT and RIGHT slots.
/
/An enzyme that is linked to a composite reaction may or may not also
/be linked to its sub-reactions -- cases when we might not want to link
/the enzyme to sub-reactions might be if one or more sub-reactions are
/spontaneous (so the enzyme would only be linked to the non-spontaneous
/sub-reactions), or if the enzyme were a complex with each of its subunits
/catalyzing a different sub-reaction (in which case it should be the subunit
/that is linked to each corresponding sub-reaction, not the complex).

UNIQUE-ID - Red-Thioredoxin
TYPES - Thioredoxin
COMMON-NAME - a reduced thioredoxin
COMMENT - Thioredoxin is a small electron-transfer protein that contains a cysteine disulfide/dithiol active site in the form of C-X-X-C.  It functions in a wide variety of cellular processes. 
/
/Thioredoxin is reduced by NADPH in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: THIOREDOXIN-REDUCT-NADPH-CPLX|. The conversion between the oxidized and reduced forms results in a change of conformation and a significant change in functional properties. The reduced thioredoxin is a powerful protein disulfide reductase that catalyzes dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions with many substrates.
/
/The oxidized form of thioredoxin has been crystallized, the reduced form has been solved by NMR |CITS: [6378624][3896121][3152490][2187529] [2193685] [8098620] [2181145]|.

//
UNIQUE-ID - TR-19
TYPES - Transport-Reactions
COMMON-NAME - Transport Reactions of Unknown or Unclassified Mechanism
//
UNIQUE-ID - TR-11
TYPES - Transport-Reactions
COMMON-NAME - Transport Facilitated by Channels and Pores
COMMENT - Reactions in this class are facilitated by a family of proteins known as channels and pores. These proteins enable the energy independent diffusion of substrates across a membrane. Generally transport is considered to occur without the need for a carrier mediated mechanism but there are exceptions to this (eg. the ligand gated fatty acid channel FadL of <i>E. coli</i>). In the IUBMB Transport Classification System, Channels and Pores (Family 1) contains 5 subfamilies including alpha-helical channels (1.A), beta strand porins (1.B), pore-forming toxins (1.C), non-ribosomally synthesized channels (1.D) and holins (1.E).

//
UNIQUE-ID - TR-12
TYPES - Transport-Reactions
COMMON-NAME - Transport Energized by the Membrane Electrochemical Gradient
COMMENT - Transport reactions in this class are catalysed by proteins which use the energy of the membrane electrochemical gradient to drive uptake or export of substrates. These membrane proteins can catalyze uniport (a single species is transported), antiport (two species are transported in opposite directions) or symport (two species are transported together in the same direction). Symporters and antiporters are secondary active transporters which use chemiosmotic energy in the form  of a proton, sodium or other solute gradient to drive transport of one substrate against it's concentration gradient. Membrane uniporters in this class catalyse the transport of a substrate down its concentration gradient in a membrane potential dependent process.<BR>Proteins catalysing these reactions are members of IUBMB Transport Classification Family 2

Terpenoid alkaloids are non-uniformly distributed in the plant kingdom. Monoterpenoid alkaloids such as gentianine are often found in the plant family <i>Gentianaceae</i>, sesquiterpenoids such as dendrobine occur largely in <i>Orchidaceae</i> or cassinine in the <i>Celastraceae</i>, diterpenoids such as aconitine are located in the family <i>Ranunculaceae</i> and steroidal alkaloids, for instance buxamine in unrelated plant families such as <i>Buxaceae</i>, protoverine in the <i>Liliacea</i> and solanidine in the <i>Solanaceae</i>. There are a number of terpenoid alkaloids exhibiting antifeedant and antifungal properties. The most interesting alkaloids of this subclass are found in the genus <i>Veratrum</i> being used for treating hypertension, neuralgia and rheumatism.

/
/This complex, in turn, combines with other snRNPs, unmodified pre-mRNA, and various other proteins to assemble a spliceosome, a large RNA-protein molecular complex that removes introns from a transcribed pre-mRNA. U6 is one of five snRNPs that are found in the spliceosome |CITS: [3041282]|.
/
/Base-pair specificity of the U6 snRNA allows the U6 snRNP to bind tightly to the U4 snRNA and loosely to the U5 snRNA  during the initial phase of the splicing reaction |CITS: [7882985]|. During the reaction cycle the U6 snRNA dissociates from U4 and binds to the U2 snRNA |CITS: [8299941]|. It is also associated with the 5' end of the intron that is being cleaved.

TYPES - All-tRNAs
COMMON-NAME - an uncharged tRNA
COMMENT - A transfer RNA (tRNA) is is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.
/
/This class encompasses uncharged tRNA molecules. The structure shown here depicts the CCA nucleotides at the 3' end of an uncharged tRNA.

COMMON-NAME - regulation of gene expression
COMMENT - This class covers any process that regulates the rate of production of a mature gene product, and so includes processes that regulate that rate by regulating the level, stability or availability of intermediates in the process of gene expression.  For example, it covers any process that regulates the level, stability or availability of mRNA or circRNA for translation and thereby regulates the rate of production of the encoded protein via translation.

COMMENT - Plastocyanin is an important copper-containing protein involved in electron-transfer in photosynthetic organisms.
/This soluble monomeric protein serves in transferring electrons between the two photosystems during photosynthesis light reactions, and more specifically, it transfers electrons between cytochrome <i>f</i> of the |FRAME: EC-7.1.1.6 "cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex (EC 7.1.1.6)"| to the P700 complex of |FRAME: EC-1.97.1.12 "photosystem I (EC 1.97.1.12)""|.
/
/Structures of the protein have been characterized crystallographically from multiple species, including poplar, algae, parsley, spinach, and French bean plants, revealing a generally conserved copper binding site. The copper center interacts with four ligands: two histidine residues, a cysteine residue, and a methionine residue |CITS: [Colman78][8399201][8027022][8204598][Badsberg96][9792096]|.

UNIQUE-ID - Apo-EntF

COMMON-NAME - an <i>apo</i>-[EntF L-seryl-carrier protein]
COMMENT - EntF is a four-domain protein that contains an N-terminal elongation/condensation domain, an adenylation domain, a peptidyl-carrier protein domain, and a C-terminal thioesterase domain |CITS: [10688898]|. It is part of the enterobactin synthase complex.
/
/<i>Holo</i>-EntF contains a covalently bound 4'-phosphopantetheine moiety that is attached posttranslationally by the EntD  enzyme to a serine side chain in the peptidyl-carrier domain. The enzyme activates L-serine through an ATP-pyrophosphate exchange reaction at the carboxylate group of L-serine, then transfers the seryl-moiety to its peptidyl-carrier domain, where it remains bound for further reactions |CITS: [3040679][1826089][1338974][8939709][9025288][22365602]|.
/
/The other substrate for EntF is |FRAME: 23DHB-EntB|, which if formed by the EntE-catalyzed acylation of the |FRAME: Holo-EntB "<i>holo</i>-EntB protein"| with |FRAME: 2-3-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE|. EntF then catalyzes formation of the three amide and three ester bonds, resulting on formation of |FRAME: ENTEROBACTIN| |CITS: [9485415]|.

TYPES - Apo-Aryl-Carrier-Proteins
COMMON-NAME - an <i>apo</i>-[EntB aryl-carrier protein]
COMMENT - EntB is a bifunctional enzyme that is involved in the |FRAME: ENTEROBACTIN| biosynthesis pathway. Enterobactin, a siderophore molecule, is synthesized in response to iron deprivation by formation of an amide bond between |FRAME: 2-3-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE| (2,3-DHB) and |FRAME: SER|.
/
/EntB is a bifunctional protein that consists of an N-terminal isochorismatase domain and a C-terminal aryl-carrier protein (ArCP) domain |CITS: [9214294]|. The isochorismatase domain catalyzes the synthesis of |FRAME: DIHYDRO-DIOH-BENZOATE| from |FRAME: ISOCHORISMATE| (|FRAME: EC-3.3.2.1|).
/
/The <i>apo</i>-ArCP domain first undergoes phosphopantetheinylation catalyzed by EntD, turning EntB into the active <i>holo</i>-EntB. The active domain then serves as a substrate for EntE, which activates |FRAME: 2-3-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE| (formed from |FRAME: DIHYDRO-DIOH-BENZOATE| by EntA) and attaches it to the ArCP domain of EntB |CITS: [9485415][9214294]|.

UNIQUE-ID - 2Fe-2S-Ferredoxins
TYPES - Ferredoxins
COMMON-NAME - a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Ferredoxins Ferredoxins| are present in all organisms, from bacteria and archaea to higher eukaryotes.
/They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to as |FRAME: FeS-Centers|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential, and do not carry out classical enzyme functions.
/
/Ferredoxins are classified into several groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. 
/
/In plant and mammalian type [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins the Fe ions are ligated by four |FRAME: CYS| residues that are present in motifs with the pattern -C-X<sub>4,5</sub>-C-X<sub>2</sub>-C-X<sub>n</sub>-C-, with n=&tilde;30.
/
/Even though each cluster contains more than one iron atom, each cluster can carry only one extra electron. Thus ferredoxins that contain a single cluster participate in single electron transfer reactions, while ferredoxins that carry two clusters can transfer two electrons simultaneously.
//
UNIQUE-ID - Reduced-ferredoxins
TYPES - Ferredoxins
COMMON-NAME - a reduced ferredoxin [iron-sulfur] cluster
SYNONYMS - a reduced ferredoxin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Ferredoxins Ferredoxins| are present in all organisms, from bacteria and archaea to higher eukaryotes.
/They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to as |FRAME: FeS-Centers "iron-sulfur clusters"|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential, and do not carry out classical enzyme functions. Ferredoxins characteristically transfer an electron
/with a reduction potential E0' near -420mV (though the reduction potential of ferredoxins from some anaerobic microorganisms can be as low as -500mV |CITS: [Li16]| and as high as -340mV |CITS: [12610725]|).
/
/Ferredoxins are classified into several groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. The |FRAME: 2Fe-2S-Ferredoxins "[2Fe-2S] ferredoxin"| group consists of monomeric proteins containing a single |FRAME: CPD-6|. This group includes ferredoxins that transfer electrons in redox chains linked to hydroxylases and oxygenases in a wide range of organisms (from bacteria to mammals), and which includes plant and algal ferredoxins that function as electron carriers in photosynthesis. A related group contains |FRAME: Rieske-Type-Ferredoxins|, where two of the cysteine groups are replaced by histidine residues.
/
/|FRAME: 4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| and |FRAME: 3Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[3Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| are typically found in bacteria. They may differ in cluster type (3Fe or 4Fe), number of clusters (one or two), and length of polypeptide chain (up to over 100 residues), and include the relatively small dual cluster |FRAME: 2-4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| that were first isolated from anaerobic bacteria |CITS: [16466637]|.
/
/Even though each cluster contains more than one iron atom, each cluster can carry only one extra electron. Thus ferredoxins that contain a single cluster participate in single electron transfer reactions, while ferredoxins that carry two clusters can transfer two electrons simultaneously.
/
/The structure given for this entry is that of a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin, and is provided for illustration only.

UNIQUE-ID - 2-4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins
TYPES - Ferredoxins
COMMON-NAME - a 2[4Fe-4s] ferredoxin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Ferredoxins Ferredoxins| are present in all organisms, from bacteria and archaea to higher eukaryotes.
/They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to as |FRAME: FeS-Centers|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential, and do not carry out classical enzyme functions.
/
/Ferredoxins are classified into several groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. 
/
/In [4Fe-4S] ferredoxins the Fe ions are ligated by four |FRAME: CYS| residues that occur in a -C-X<sub>2</sub>-C-X<sub>2</sub>-C-X<sub>n</sub>- pattern. This pattern is duplicated in ferredoxins that contain two [4Fe-4S] clusters.
/
/Even though each cluster contains more than one iron atom, each cluster can carry only one extra electron. Thus ferredoxins that contain a single cluster participate in single electron transfer reactions, while ferredoxins that carry two clusters can transfer two electrons simultaneously.

COMMENT - This term should only be used to annotate a protein modification process that occurs after the protein has been released from the ribosome, and is therefore strictly post-translational. Modification of a free protein (one not attached to a ribosome) and modification of a C-terminal residue are post-translational processes. Some protein modifications occur while the protein is still in the ribosome but before translation has been completed; these modification processes are considered co-translational and should not be annotated using this term.

UNIQUE-ID - Quinones

COMMON-NAME - a quinone
SYNONYMS - quinone
COMMENT - Quinones are organic compounds derived from aromatic compounds, with two carbonyl groups incorporated into the ring structure with rearrangement of the double bonds where necessary. Quinones are conjugated but not aromatic.
/
/A classic example of a quinone is |FRAME: P-BENZOQUINONE|. Quinones are commonly named with a prefix that indicates the parent aromatic hydrocarbon (for example, "benzo-" for benzene, "naphtho-" for naphthalene, and "anthra-" for anthracene) with a "-quinone" suffix.
/
/Several types of quinones serve as electron acceptors in electron transport chains. Quinones can carry two electrons, and when fully reduced they are referred to as |FRAME: Reduced-Quinones quinols|. The addition of a single H atom to a quinone results in formation of a free radical called |FRAME: Semiquinones|.
/
/Many quinone derivatives often have other biological activities, such as |FRAME: CPD-11501 "vitamin K"|.

UNIQUE-ID - Electron-Transfer-Reactions
TYPES - Composite-Reactions
COMMENT - Electron transfer reactions (ETRs) describe reactions that transfer
/electrons between substrates, which are thus involved in redox
/processes that oxidize and reduce some of the substrates.  ETRs
/usually take place at membranes, because a key purpose of ETRs is to
/use the electron energy to build up a proton gradient across the
/membrane, which can then be used for energy generation by the cell,
/using ATP synthesis driven by the proton gradient.  ETRs very often
/involve the pool of membrane-bound quinone substrates, which can
/shuttle electrons to or from an ETR.
/
/All ETRs are composite reactions, because they involve at least two
/redox half reactions.  These half reactions involve explicit
/electrons, which cannot occur freely. Thus, the half reactions have to
/be paired up, with the result that the electrons are used only
/internally to connect the half reactions, and are not visible
/as substrates of the ETR.
/
/Sometimes, a proton transport reaction can also be a sub-reaction of
/the ETR, to represent so-called vectoral proton movement.  In the
/vectoral case, protons are actively pumped across the membrane, using
/energy extracted from the redox processes.  The proton transport
/reaction is not directly connected to the redox half reactions in the
/pathway representation of the composite reaction.
/
/Because ETRs tend to occur at membranes, substrates that are not in
/the default compartment (the cytoplasm) need to have compartment
/information associated by means of value annotations.  The exception
/to this are the membrane-bound quinone substrates, which are always
/assumed to reside in the membrane itself.

UNIQUE-ID - Charged-tRNAs

COMMON-NAME - a charged tRNA
SYNONYMS - an aminoacyl-tRNA
COMMENT - |FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

SYNONYMS - a tRNA(Sec)
SYNONYMS - a tRNA<sup>[Ser]Sec</sup>
COMMENT - tRNA(sec) is a special tRNA that inserts selenocysteine at certain in-frame UGA codons.
/
/tRNAs are the adapters that allow synthesis of proteins from mRNAs. Each tRNA carries a specific amino acid to the ribosome for protein synthesis. There, the tRNA recognizes an RNA codon with its own three-nucleotide anticodon, thus allowing synthesis of a specific peptide based on an mRNA template.
/
/tRNA(sec) can insert selenocysteine at certain in-frame UGA codons |CITS: [3033637]|. The ability of tRNA(sec) to insert selenocysteine appears to depend on the specific sequence and folding of a stem-loop 3' to the insertion site |CITS: [1834670][1396569]|. tRNA(sec) has poor affinity for the normal elongation factor EF-Tu, instead binding to the specialized |FRAME: EG10942-MONOMER| |CITS: [2408012][2531290]|. The aminoacyl acceptor helix of tRNA(sec) promotes binding to |FRAME: EG10942-MONOMER| and prevents binding to EF-Tu |CITS: [1939093][2524495]|. 
/
/Mature tRNAs are linked via a 3' CCA sequence to their cognate amino acid in an ATP-dependent fashion by the appropriate amino-acid-tRNA synthetase, as shown in the |FRAME: TRNA-CHARGING-PWY|. tRNA(sec) is charged in a two-step process, being aminoacylated with L-serine by |FRAME: SERS-CPLX|, then having that associated amino acid converted to selenocysteine by |FRAME: CPLX0-1141|, as shown in |FRAME: PWY0-901| |CITS: [2963963][1839607]|. Subsequently, these charged tRNAs interact with the ribosome and template mRNA to generate polypeptides. The discovery of the role of tRNA in protein synthesis is reviewed in detail in |CITS: [7033244]|.
/
/tRNA(sec) varies in areas that are otherwise invariant across most tRNAs |CITS: [2963963][2529478]|. Many of these differences act to prevent incorrect addition of selenocysteine at random UGA stop codons |CITS: [1370545]|. tRNA(sec) has an unusual acceptor stem consisting of eight, rather than seven base pairs, which is required for proper function |CITS: [1702199]|.

SYNONYMS - TRNA(ILE)
COMMENT - tRNA<SUP>Ile</SUP> is the |FRAME: All-tRNAs tRNA| molecule that binds |FRAME: ILE|. 
/
/|FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.
/
/The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule.

TYPES - 2-4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins
TYPES - Reduced-ferredoxins
COMMON-NAME - a reduced 2[4Fe-4s] ferredoxin
COMMENT - |FRAME: Ferredoxins Ferredoxins| are present in all organisms, from bacteria and archaea to higher eukaryotes.
/They are small and acidic proteins with prosthetic groups composed of iron and sulfur atoms, which are referred to as |FRAME: FeS-Centers "iron-sulfur clusters"|. The ferredoxins function as intracellular electron carriers with a low reduction potential.
/
/Ferredoxins are classified into several groups according to the types and numbers of their Fe-S clusters. The |FRAME: 2Fe-2S-Ferredoxins "[2Fe-2S] ferredoxin"| group consists of monomeric proteins containing a single |FRAME: CPD-6|. This group includes ferredoxins that transfer electrons in redox chains linked to hydroxylases and oxygenases in a wide range of organisms (from bacteria to mammals), and which includes plant and algal ferredoxins that function as electron carriers in photosynthesis. A related group contains |FRAME: Rieske-Type-Ferredoxins|, where two of the cysteine groups are replaced by histidine residues.
/
/|FRAME: 4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| and |FRAME: 3Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "[3Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| are typically found in bacteria. They may differ in cluster type (3Fe or 4Fe), number of clusters (one or two), and length of polypeptide chain (up to over 100 residues), and include the relatively small dual cluster |FRAME: 2-4Fe-4S-Ferredoxins "2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins"| that were first isolated from anaerobic bacteria |CITS: [16466637]|.
/
/Even though each cluster contains more than one iron atom, each cluster can carry only one extra electron. Thus ferredoxins that contain a single cluster participate in single electron transfer reactions, while ferredoxins that carry two clusters can transfer two electrons simultaneously.
/
/In [4Fe-4S] ferredoxins the Fe ions are ligated by four |FRAME: CYS| residues that occur in a -C-X<sub>2</sub>-C-X<sub>2</sub>-C-X<sub>n</sub>- pattern. This pattern is duplicated in ferredoxins that contain two [4Fe-4S] clusters.

UNIQUE-ID - Cys-tRNA-Pro

COMMON-NAME - an L-cysteinyl-[tRNA<sup>Pro</sup>]
COMMENT - |FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.
/
/The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule with an L-prolyl group bound to the terminal 3'-OH group, as is the case in |FRAME: TAX-562| and yeast |CITS: [17206069]|.

COMMENT - The messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of all metazoan organisms and most eukaryotic viruses possess a 5' cap structure consisting of a 7-methyl guanosine (m7G) linked via an inverted 5'5' triphosphate bridge to the initiating nucleoside
/of the transcript.  The inverted m7G, which is also known as a cap0 structure, marks transcription start sites, and has multiple effects on gene expression, including enhancement of RNA stability, splicing, nucleocytoplasmic transport and translation initiation, as facilitated by interactions with nuclear and cytoplasmic cap binding proteins.
/
/The initiating nucleoside of the transcript, and often the second transcribed nucleotide, are modified by 2'-O-ribose methylation. Methylation of the ribose on the first transcribed nucleotide is termed cap1 and similar methylation of the second transcribed position is termed cap2 |CITS: [21310715]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group of the aminoacyl-adenylate to the 2' or 3' terminal OH of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes).

COMMENT - |FRAME: All-tRNAs "A transfer RNA"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.
/
/There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.
/
/The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 
/
/The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.
